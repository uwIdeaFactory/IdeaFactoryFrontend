## Contributions of individual team members
### Previous week's goal
* N/A for the first week


### Progress and Issues
* All Members: Discussed the design for database design in Thursday's lecture, and some entities and dependencies for the user information and some project information are determined.
* All Members: Discussed the design and some implementation details for the search function on Tuesday's lecture and adjusted the tools to use. Specifically, some search APIs are expensive and may be too advanced for our project, and the original database Firebase doesn't seem to be an optimal design for query selection, so we decided to use MongoDB instead and keep Firebase to be the tool for user authentication
* Zhengrui Sun: Start designing the UI/UX for the app and check details with all other members in Tuesday's class




### Plans and goals for the next week
* Zhengrui Sun: Finish the design for UI/UX interface
* Allan Ji, Caleb Huang: Start creating a frontend demo using React
* Bohan Wu: Finish building database (MongoDB + Google Firebase)
* Yansong Liu, Dicheng Wu: Start to implement api for posting feature by node.js, research on how to implement the searching feature, and figure out how the search feature can cooperate with the selected database
